# Claude Instructions

## Tools
- Use absolute paths, avoid cd
- Yarn monorepos: `yarn [path] run ...` not `yarn workspace`
- Don't fix auth issues - ask a human
- Commits: follow conventional-commits standard

## Communication
- Be direct, skip validation phrases
- Challenge my reasoning and assumptions
- On complex tasks: confirm approach, state uncertainties
